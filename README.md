# React assessment

**Project goal**:
	You are building a simple inventory management system to help track products in a warehouse. The system should allow users to add, update, delete, and view products in real-time. Users should be required to log in before they can access the inventory. The project should use Firebase for the backend and React for the frontend. The goal of this test is to evaluate how you approach problem-solving, structure your code, and work with technologies you may not be entirely familiar with. You are free to use any libraries or tools you think are appropriate.

**Tech stack**:
	React + Firebase

**Results**:
	After reading over the project I was quickly able to put together a list of steps for how I wanted to complete it:
		CRUD Functionality; The User can view all, add, edit, and delete products.
		Add Firebase database; Using Firestore database for data persistence
		Add Auth; Using Firebase's authentication (not in the final product)
		Deploy to GitHub Pages; What I used to deploy my portfolio website so it was the quickest task.
		
Within 2 hours of this assessment, I was able to achieve the minimum CRUD application with Firebase functionality. I went through most of the Github Pages process once I realized how long authentication would take to set up with Firebase as I was cutting close to the 2 hour mark so I decided to focus on deployment instead. Overall I found this assessment to be fun as I have previous experience on these platforms though in different environments. I was able to quickly look things up in the Firebase documentation or look for packages I may need such as the UUID package. Looking back on how I believe that maybe I should've gotten authentication up before working on the app as I would've had to go back and add authentication to the pages and check the auth level for the user: "Customer" or "Manager."

The final product can be found live [here](https://matthewm5293.github.io/ReactAssessment/)
